Here’s the **Replit-ready implementation prompt** you can paste directly into your project so it creates the Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Refund Policy pages you need for Paddle domain approval — and verifies they’re working before giving you the final URLs to submit.

## **Prompt for Replit**

**Title:**
Create and verify Terms, Privacy, and Refund policy pages for Paddle domain review

**Description / Steps:**

We need to create 3 working pages on the landing page `https://typebeatz.voodoo808.com` so Paddle can verify our domain:

1. Terms of Service
2. Privacy Policy
3. Refund Policy

All must be **accessible via HTTPS** and **linked in the footer**. After creation, Replit should test the pages, confirm HTTP 200 OK status, and return the working URLs so they can be pasted into Paddle’s dashboard.

---

### **Step 1 – Create Pages**

* Add **Terms of Service** route: `/terms-of-service`
  Include:

  * Legal business name (Voodoo808, OSVČ, IČO: XXXXXXXX)
  * Description of product (Type Beatz desktop app, macOS + Windows)
  * Purchase/license terms (PRO \$79 one-time, what’s included)
  * Restrictions (no resale, no redistribution, etc.)
  * Liability disclaimer, governing law, contact info

* Add **Privacy Policy** route: `/privacy-policy`
  Include:

  * Data collected: email (support/purchases), Paddle transaction info, cookies, analytics (if used)
  * How data is used and stored
  * Third-party processors: Paddle, hosting provider, analytics tools (if any)
  * User rights (access, deletion) and contact email

* Add **Refund Policy** route: `/refund-policy`
  Include:

  * Refund eligibility (e.g., 30 days from purchase, no abuse, must have proof of purchase)
  * How to request: email [app@voodoo808.com](mailto:app@voodoo808.com)
  * Processing time and method (refund via Paddle)

---

### **Step 2 – Footer Links**

* In the footer, ensure these are linked:

  * “Terms & Conditions” → `/terms-of-service`
  * “Privacy Policy” → `/privacy-policy`
  * “Refund Policy” → `/refund-policy`

---

### **Step 3 – Pricing Page**

* Make sure `/pricing` exists or a section on the homepage clearly shows:

  * \$79 PRO one-time
  * What’s included in PRO purchase (deliverables)
  * Paddle checkout button (sandbox mode for now)

---

### **Step 4 – Verification & Troubleshooting**

After implementing, Replit should:

1. Start local or deployed build
2. Automatically check all 3 policy page URLs for:

   * ✅ HTTP 200 status
   * ✅ Contains at least 300 characters of real text
   * ✅ Visible from public web (no login required)
3. If a page fails any check:

   * Log which check failed
   * Retry after re-rendering/rebuilding
4. Once all 3 pass, print:

```
✅ Pages ready for Paddle submission:
Terms of Service: https://typebeatz.voodoo808.com/terms-of-service
Privacy Policy: https://typebeatz.voodoo808.com/privacy-policy
Refund Policy: https://typebeatz.voodoo808.com/refund-policy
Pricing page: https://typebeatz.voodoo808.com/pricing
```

---

### **Step 5 – Deliverables**

* [ ] `/terms-of-service` live with content above
* [ ] `/privacy-policy` live with content above
* [ ] `/refund-policy` live with content above
* [ ] All footer links working and correct
* [ ] Pricing page/section live
* [ ] Final tested URLs output for Paddle

If you want, I can also **write the exact content** for each of those 3 pages so you can just paste it in and skip the legal writing step.
Do you want me to prepare those ready-to-paste texts next?
