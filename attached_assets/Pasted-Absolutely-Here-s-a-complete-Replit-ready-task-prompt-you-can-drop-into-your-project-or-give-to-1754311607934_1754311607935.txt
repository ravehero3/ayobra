Absolutely. Here’s a **complete Replit-ready task prompt** you can drop into your project or give to whoever’s implementing it. It makes all footer links work, populates the required content (so Paddle domain review passes), and integrates the Paddle checkout.

## **Title**

Make footer links functional, add required policy pages, and integrate Paddle checkout for Type Beatz PRO

## **Description / Instructions**

We need to fully implement all footer links on `https://typebeatz.voodoo808.com`, populate each target page with the correct content (legal, support, docs, etc.), and integrate the Paddle PRO checkout for the \$79 one-time license so Paddle domain review passes. Do the following tasks:

---

### 1. **Routing & Navigation**

* Ensure every footer link is a working route in the React app (SPA or separate pages):

  * Product (scrolls/promotes main product section)
  * Features (anchors to features)
  * Pricing (pricing section)
  * Download (links to download area or triggers OS-specific download)
  * Changelog (`/changelog`)
  * Support (`/support`)
  * Documentation (`/docs`)
  * Tutorials (`/tutorials`)
  * Contact (`/contact`)
  * Discord (external link to Discord invite)
  * Legal group:

    * Privacy Policy (`/privacy`)
    * Terms & Conditions (`/terms`)
    * Refund Policy (`/refund`)
    * License Agreement (`/license`)
    * EULA (`/eula`)

### 3. **Paddle Checkout Integration**

* Embed the Paddle checkout for the **PRO \$79 one-time license**:

  * Use Paddle’s official checkout script with the correct product ID.
  * Place “Upgrade to PRO” / “Buy PRO” button(s) linking to that checkout.
  * On success redirect to a thank-you page (`/thank-you`) with:

    * Confirmation message.
    * Instructions or download link (or “check your email” if delivering via email).
* Implement a **webhook endpoint** (can be a stub initially) to receive Paddle purchase events (e.g., `/api/webhooks/paddle`) for future automation (license activation, logging, etc.).
* Store minimal purchase metadata client/server-side if needed (for future user history sync).

---

### 4. **Visual / Trust Signals**

* Display your **legal identity** somewhere in footer or small note:
  `Type Beatz is a product of Voodoo808 (OSVČ, IČO: XXXXXXXX)`
* Show “What’s included with PRO” bullets near the checkout button so reviewers instantly see deliverables.
* Ensure the PRO price is clearly shown as “\$79 one-time” on the pricing section and checkout trigger.

---

### 5. **Technical & Compliance**

* All policy & legal pages must be reachable via navigation (footer) from every page.
* Ensure the site is fully HTTPS and there are no broken links.
* Capture a screenshot of:

  * Pricing section with \$79 PRO.
  * Visible navigation including Privacy, Terms, Refund.
  * Checkout button visible (can be sandbox mode) for Paddle’s review if asked.

Would you like me to generate the exact boilerplate Markdown/React components for the Terms, Privacy Policy, Refund Policy, EULA, and support page so you can paste them directly into the project?
