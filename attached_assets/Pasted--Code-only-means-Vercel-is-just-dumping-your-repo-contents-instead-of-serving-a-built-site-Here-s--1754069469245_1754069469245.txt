“Code only” means Vercel is just dumping your repo contents instead of serving a built site. Here’s what to do **in the Replit shell** step by step to diagnose & fix it:

### 1. Inspect your `package.json` and confirm scripts

```bash
cat package.json | head -n 120
```

(If it's longer, you can just open it in the editor too.)
You need at least:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview"
}
```

If those are missing, add them.

### 2. Make sure you have Vite & Tailwind installed

```bash
npm install
```

If Tailwind isn’t set up yet, scaffold minimal config:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Then in `tailwind.config.js` ensure `content` includes your source files, e.g.:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: { extend: {} },
  plugins: [],
}
```

And in your CSS entry (e.g., `src/index.css` or similar):

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Ensure that CSS is imported in your entrypoint (e.g., `main.jsx` or `index.jsx`).

### 3. Run a local build to confirm it produces output

```bash
npm run build
```

You should see a `dist/` directory created. List it to verify:

```bash
ls -R dist | head -n 60
```

### 4. Commit the working build config / any fixes and push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vite build scripts / landing page config"
git push origin main
```

### 5. Ensure Vercel is using the correct build settings

In the Vercel dashboard for your project, confirm:

* **Framework preset:** Vite (keep it)
* **Build Command:** `npm run build`
* **Output Directory:** `dist`

If those were wrong, correct them and trigger a redeploy (you can also force it via):

```bash
vercel --prod
```

(from where you’ve logged in, if using CLI; otherwise push to GitHub and let Vercel auto-deploy)

### 6. (Optional) Add a `vercel.json` to be explicit

Create `vercel.json` in repo root with:

```json
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": { "distDir": "dist" }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

Then commit & push:

```bash
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Add vercel.json to force static build routing"
git push
```

If you paste the relevant part of your `package.json` here (or I can help you with a minimal one), I’ll tailor the exact edits. Do you want me to generate a minimal Vite+React+Tailwind starter `package.json` and config to drop into your repo?
