Type Beat Video Generator - Complete App Summary
Overview
This is a desktop application built for music producers to create type beat videos by pairing audio files (MP3/WAV) with images (PNG/JPG). The app features a futuristic dark glassmorphism theme with neon accents and provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for file management and video generation.

Key Components Structure
Main App Component (src/App.jsx)
The central component orchestrating the entire application flow:

State Management:

Manages pairs of audio-image combinations
Tracks video generation progress and completion
Handles drag-and-drop states for UI interactions
Controls file upload and processing workflows
Core Functions:

handleFileDrop(): Processes dropped files and creates audio-image pairs
handleGenerateVideos(): Initiates FFmpeg video generation process
handleSwap(): Enables dragging containers between pairs for reorganization
Drag state management for visual feedback during container operations
UI Sections:

Empty state with centered drop instructions
Dynamic pair grid that scales based on uploaded content
Action buttons (Generate, Stop, Download) with animated states
Generated videos display grid with preview cards
Batch status indicator showing overall progress
Store Management (src/store/appStore.js)
Zustand-based centralized state management:

Core State:

{
  pairs: [], // Audio-image pair objects with unique IDs
  generatedVideos: [], // Completed video metadata and URLs
  isGenerating: false, // Global generation state
  isCancelling: false, // Cancellation state
  progress: 0 // Overall progress percentage
}
Key Functions:

setPairs(): Updates pair configurations
addGeneratedVideo(): Stores completed video data
setVideoGenerationState(): Updates individual pair progress
getCompletePairs(): Filters pairs ready for processing
Media Processing Pipeline
File Handling (src/hooks/usePairingLogic.js)
Validation: Separate utilities for audio (MP3/WAV) and image (PNG/JPG/HEIC) validation
Automatic Pairing: Smart algorithm that pairs dropped files optimally
Container Management: Creates exactly the number of containers needed (no empty containers)
Drag Operations: Handles container reordering and content swapping
Video Generation (src/hooks/useFFmpeg.js)
FFmpeg Integration: Initializes and manages FFmpeg.wasm instances
Concurrent Processing: Optimized for 2-3 simultaneous video generations
Progress Tracking: Real-time progress callbacks for each video
Cancellation System: Immediate termination of all processes
Output Specs: 1920x1080 MP4 videos with AAC audio at 320k bitrate
FFmpeg Processor (src/utils/ffmpegProcessor.js)
Video Layout: White background with 30px vertical spacing
Image Processing: 10px padding above/below images, proper centering
Audio Integration: High-quality audio preservation with visual waveform overlay
Performance Optimization: Memory management and cleanup procedures
UI Components
Pair Containers (src/components/Pairs.jsx)
Layout: Side-by-side audio and image containers in horizontal pairs
Styling: Modern glassmorphism with semi-transparent dark backgrounds
Interaction: Individual drag handles for container reordering
Visual Feedback: Hover effects, drag indicators, and swap animations
Audio Container (src/components/AudioContainer.jsx)
Waveform Display: WaveSurfer.js integration with custom styling
Playback Controls: Circular play/pause button with audio position tracking
File Info: Tooltips showing filename, duration, and file size
Drag Functionality: Move handle for container reordering and content swapping
Image Container (src/components/ImageContainer.jsx)
Image Display: Object-contain sizing to show complete images
Glassmorphism Styling: Consistent with audio containers
File Info: Tooltips with filename, dimensions, and file size
Drag System: Matching drag functionality with audio containers
Video Preview (src/components/VideoPreviewCard.jsx)
Video Player: Native HTML5 video with custom controls
Download Options: Individual and bulk download functionality
Metadata Display: Generated video information and file sizes
Grid Layout: Responsive grid for multiple video display
Drag and Drop System
Global File Drop
Full-Window Drop Zone: Entire app surface accepts file drops
Visual Feedback: Animated overlay with drop instructions
File Processing: Automatic validation and pairing of dropped files
Smart Pairing: Algorithm matches audio and images optimally
Container Dragging
Content Swapping: Audio containers swap only with audio, images with images
Visual Indicators: Green borders and scaling effects during drag operations
Cursor Following: Drag copies follow mouse cursor with smooth animations
Drop Validation: Prevents invalid drops with visual feedback
Styling System
Glassmorphism Theme (src/styles/globals.css)
Background: Semi-transparent dark backgrounds with backdrop blur
Borders: Subtle white borders with inner shadows
Noise Texture: Background noise overlay for premium feel
Gradients: Purple-to-blue gradients for action buttons
Animation System
Framer Motion: Smooth page transitions and component animations
CSS Animations: Custom keyframes for loading states and hover effects
Progress Indicators: Animated progress bars during video generation
Drag Feedback: Real-time visual feedback during drag operations
Video Generation Workflow
File Upload: Users drag audio/image files into the application
Automatic Pairing: System creates optimal audio-image pairs
Preview Stage: Users can preview waveforms, images, and reorder pairs
Generation Trigger: "Generate Videos" button initiates FFmpeg processing
Concurrent Processing: Multiple videos process simultaneously with progress tracking
Completion: Generated videos appear in preview grid with download options
